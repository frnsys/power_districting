## Notes

TODO document:

- EJ data source
- Add additional constraints: crossover districts, EJ data
- Incorporate energy infrastructure as a constraint?

## Usage

1. Run `gen_graph.py` to generate the district graph data.
    - Whenever you want to include different data in the initial graph, update `keep_layers` in that file, and re-run.
    - This produces `gen/graph.json`
2. Run `gen_districts.py` to generate districting proposals.
